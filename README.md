# AirlineDB_Analysis_SQL
# Overview
AirlineDB is a comprehensive database management system to handle the complex data requirements of an airline company. The system provides an efficient and scalable solution for managing flight schedules, bookings, passenger information and more enabling airlines to streamline their operations and enhance the passenger experience.

# Project Overview
This SQL Capstone Project was undertaken to enhance and showcase proficiency in SQL by working with a simulated airline database. The project involves writing and executing complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data. The queries were designed to cover a wide range of SQL functionalities, including data transformation, joining multiple tables, window functions, and subqueries.

# Key Features
- **Data Extraction and Transformation**: 
  - Retrieved passenger details including ticket number, boarding number, and seat number.
  - Identified the least allocated seat numbers.
  - Determined the month-wise highest and lowest paying passengers.

- **Complex Joins and Aggregations**: 
  - Analyzed non-stop and return journeys by counting the number of flights per ticket.
  - Counted tickets without boarding passes.
  - Identified the longest flight based on duration.

- **Flight Schedules**:
  - Filtered flights scheduled in the morning (6 AM to 11 AM).
  - Extracted the earliest morning flight available from each airport.

- **Geographical Insights**:
  - Retrieved a list of airport codes in the Europe/Moscow timezone.
  - Identified the airport with the maximum and minimum number of departure flights.

- **Flight and Aircraft Analysis**:
  - Analyzed flight counts between specific airports.
  - Identified flights using aircrafts from specific companies (e.g., Airbus, Boeing) that were canceled or delayed.
  - Listed aircraft codes with at least one business class seat.

- **Cancellations and Refunds**:
  - Calculated refunds for customers due to flight cancellations.
  - Extracted a list of Airbus flights that were canceled.

# Technology Used
- **SQL**: Primary language used for writing queries.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database system used to store and manage the airline data.

# Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience with SQL and enabled the extraction of complex data insights from an airline database. The skills gained through this project will be applicable to real-world data analysis tasks in various domains.
